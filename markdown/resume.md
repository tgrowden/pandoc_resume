> I'm a problem-solver: a full-stack software developer with a passion for front-end engineering. I excel at making elegant solutions to all sorts of problems. When I'm not writing code I enjoy seeing live music, enjoying a solid bourbon cocktail, finding the fabled five-star dive bar in my neighborhood, and working with my hands.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Open Source
:   I love open source. You can check out some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/tgrowden).

Expertise
:  Although I've worked with plenty of other technologies, **Typescript** is my language of choice; it is powerful and performant, provides type-safety (while being compatible with current JS stacks), and the ecosystem is fast-paced and exciting. I have plenty of experience with **React**, **Rust**, and **WASM**. For data-source solutions, I have plenty of experience with **Postgres**, **Redis**, and **ElasticSearch**. I am also interested in **GraphQL**, **MongoDB**.
